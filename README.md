###About CatchCat###

CatCatch is a  amazing strategy game. Itâ€™s a square shape are full of small circles. Every time you click on a circle, the cat 
takes one leap. Cat can leap in any direction but it can not leap into a circle where you have already clicked. So, now the game
is that, you should click on circles in such a way that the cat is rounded with all clicked circles so that it is not able to 
move to the end of the square. Once it moves to the end of the square, it will run away and user loses the game. It is fun and 
entertaining but it is very much challenging as well. It seems easy but when you start playing you will understand the challenge
in holding the cat from running away.

Enjoy it anyway~
